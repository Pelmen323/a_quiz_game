# A Quiz Game

This is a quiz game project in Python.

Written myself as a studying practice. Contains - Python quiz (50 questions, questions are constantly added), HTTP/REST quiz (35 questions)
General idea - print the contents of the dictionary and check if user input == stored value

Current functionality:
- Easy scalability - add as many questions as you want into the dictionaries or create new tests and integrate them!
- Ability to select the test when starting the game
- Basic foolproof - anything but allowed input will be rejected
- Shuffling - questions are printed in random order
- Questions are numbered regardless of the shuffling
- Replayability - restart the game as much as you want
- Score system  - correct answer adds +1 to the score
- Comments to understand what each line of code do
- Displaying inputted and expected answers at the end of the game
- Displaying the # of current questions
- Displaying the % of correctly answered questions
- Exit the game by typing "End"
