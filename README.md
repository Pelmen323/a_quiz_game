# A Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game project in Python.

Written myself as a studying practice.
Questions can be added into a 'questions' dictionary

Current functionality:
- Easy scalability - add as many questions as you want into the dictionary 'questions'
- Ability to select the test when starting the game:
Currently contains Python test, based on W3Schools quiz, and HTTP test
- Basic foolproof - anything but allowed input will be rejected
- Shuffling - questions are printed in random order
- Questions are numbered regardless of the shuffling
- Replayability - restart the game as much as you want
- Score system  - correct answer adds +1 to the score
- Comments to understand what each line of code do
- Displaying inputted and expected answers at the end of the game
- Displaying the # of current questions
- Displaying the % of correctly answered questions
- Exit the game by typing "End"

Whoever reads this - have a nice day :)
